          <h5>If you’ve had a vision screening recently, you might say, “My vision is fine! I don’t need a comprehensive
            eye exam.” But a vision screening provides a limited perspective on the overall health of your eyes. It’s a
            bit like getting your blood pressure checked and not getting the rest of your annual physical. You’ll have
            useful information. But it’s not the whole picture. Comprehensive eye exams look at your total health
            history. Even though you visit a separate office for your eye health, that doesn’t mean your eyes shouldn’t
            be treated holistically. Your eye doctor will discuss your overall health and that of your immediate family,
            any medications you’re taking and whether you have high blood pressure or diabetes. They’ll also want to
            know if you smoke and how much sun exposure you get. All these factors help the eye doctor properly assess
            your eye health.</h5>
